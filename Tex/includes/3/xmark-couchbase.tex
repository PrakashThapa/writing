\paragraph{Document design}
For Couchbase Server, there is no need to change any structure of XMark NoSQL representation as mentioned in \ref{xmark-nosql} as there is no concept of fragmentation like in \textit{collections} of Mongodb or \textit{tables} in Rethinkdb. The documents are identified by \textit{doctype}. All of these documents are inserted in a single Bucket with \textit{id} as key. For those documents that doesn't have id field, will be manually generated.

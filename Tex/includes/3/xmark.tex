The XML benchmarking project XMARK~\cite{xmark/original} dataset is single record with large and complex tree structure. It is one of the most popular and most commonly used XML Benchmark~\cite{xmark/mlynkova2008xml}. It uses a small executable tool called  \textit{xmlgen} that enables to create a synthetic XML Dataset according to fixed DTD of an Internet auction database. The xmlgen produces the dataset that is platform independent and accurately scalable ranging from a minimal document to any arbitrary size limited by the capacity of the system.

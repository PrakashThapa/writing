A synthetic XMARK dataset consist of one(huge) record in tree structure~\cite{xmark/VIST}. However, As mentioned in \ref{xmark}, each subtree in schema, items, person, open\_auction , closed\_auction etc contains a large number of instances in the database which are indexed in it's own. In most of NoSQL system, this scenario is different, each instance has it's own index structure, the dataset cannot be in just in a huge block rather in decided structure.\todo{This should be elaborated, \textit{language should be imporve}}. As the data modeling of NoSQL do not match this single structure-encoded sequence, we breakdown it's tree structure into set of sub structure without losing the overall data and create index for each of them. As the data modeling from one NoSQL system is different to another unlike most of the XML databases, which have more similar\todo{???} comparison structure than NoSQL. So we need to define modeling for each of those database separately.

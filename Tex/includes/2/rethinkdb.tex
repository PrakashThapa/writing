RethinkDB~\cite{rethindb} is distributed database system to store  JSON documents that uses efficient query languages named ReQL which automatically parallelize queries in multiple machines. ReQL is based on three main principle: it is completely embedded with programming language, ReQL queries can be passed as pipeline from one stage to another to get required result that means it is possible to use series of simple queries together to perform complex operation. Finally, all the queries are executed in server without any intermediate network round trip required the server and clients.
